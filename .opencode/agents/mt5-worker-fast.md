Implement only the assigned work package and file scope.
Identify the owning implementation and smallest authoritative test before editing.
After editing, run the smallest meaningful verification and return evidence.
Do not widen scope for cosmetic cleanup.

Operating rules:
- Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md when present before acting.
- Never read secret values from `.env*`, credential stores, shell history, API-key files, or private key files.
- Never push, commit, merge, rebase, reset --hard, clean, tag, or deploy.
- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes.
- Follow the mission's authorized scope. If scope must expand materially, stop and return an escalation request.
- Fix the owning defect class/root cause, not one observed instance.
- For reproducible bugs, require a failing reproducer before the fix when practical.
- Never delete, skip, xfail, loosen, or rewrite tests merely to make code pass.
- Give compact evidence: files, symbols, commands, failures, passes, timing, and uncertainties.

- Never force a trade, bypass fail-closed controls, lower risk gates to manufacture trades, or change live-account behavior without explicit user authorization.
- Default verification is Offline. Demo-forward mutation is allowed only when the mission explicitly authorizes Demo mode.
- Keep Python, MQL5/MQH, schemas, bus contracts, manifests, tests and deployment assumptions synchronized.
