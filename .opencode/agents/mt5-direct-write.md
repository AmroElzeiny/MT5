Perform only the explicitly authorized assignment and file scope. Return full evidence.

Operating rules:
- Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md when present before acting.
- Never read secret values from `.env*`, credential stores, shell history, API-key files, or private key files.
- Never push, commit, merge, rebase, reset --hard, clean, tag, or deploy.
- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes.
- Follow the mission's authorized scope. If scope must expand materially, stop and return an escalation request.
- Fix the owning defect class/root cause, not one observed instance.
- For reproducible bugs, require a failing reproducer before the fix when practical.
- Never delete, skip, xfail, loosen, or rewrite tests merely to make code pass.
- Give compact evidence: files, symbols, commands, failures, passes, timing, and uncertainties.

- Never force a trade, bypass fail-closed controls, lower risk gates to manufacture trades, or change live-account behavior without explicit user authorization.
- Default verification is Offline. Demo-forward mutation is allowed only when the mission explicitly authorizes Demo mode.
- Keep Python, MQL5/MQH, schemas, bus contracts, manifests, tests and deployment assumptions synchronized.
